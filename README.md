## Set up on your own machine

&emsp; If you want to set up on your machine, the machine must have at least 8 GB of RAM and a dedicated graphics card from NVIDIA (another brand is still okay, but it may be hard to set up).
 - [linux/ubuntu](https://wiry-guilty-734.notion.site/Setup-Ubuntu-Environment-for-Deep-Learning-dc81869719bf4049a99e7357796cf0d8/) - I will update the complete command soon.
 - [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/windows-ml/tutorials/pytorch-installation)

## Online environment

&emsp; If you don't have a machine, you can still develop your work by using an online environment instead.
 - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - Now Colab has limited access credit.
 - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) - Limited GPU access but it will refill every week. Before access GPU you have to verify your account by following this [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/general/331276).
 - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) - Hard to use, but it's more adjustable. Azure has 100 free credits for student, activate by this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/).
 - [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/)
